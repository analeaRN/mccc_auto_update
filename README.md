# The Sims 4 Helper 0.1

Helps manage The Sims 4 by providing automation for:
- cache clean up
- save back ups TODO
- mod back ups TODO
- some mod updates (public ver mc_cc)
- etc.

## Description

If you are interested in a fully fledged Mod Manager for TS4, 
you should look [@ CursedForge](https://thesims4.curseforge.com)! 
During the time I was creating this script for her, I learned about the newly created mod manager. I was already almost done with this one when I heard of it's upcoming release so I decided to just finished it for the practice and use it as a work-sample my resume ðŸ˜Š.

The original private version (for myself & my sister) supports updating other mods but I striped it from this public version since the official mod manager offers a gui..

Other than that, this script offers a way to quickly do some automated tasks, such as:
- clean game cache
- more to come.

## Original Motivation (pre-CursedForge)

There ~~is~~ was no central hub that TS4 modders had upload their content. 
Mods were often distributed amongst their own personal spaces, such as: their tumblers, sites, and/or patreon. 
This script goes out to those individual sites, looks for the **applicable endpoint** that downloads the mod associated with current game version, and then updates the mod for the user.
