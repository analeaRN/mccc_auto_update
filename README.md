# The Sims 4 Helper 0.1

Helps manage The Sims 4 by updating some mods (public version only mccc) and other automation processes:
- cache clean up TODO
- save back ups TODO
- mod back ups TODO
- etc.

## Description

Something I put together for my sister. She doesn't know how to update script mods so I thre this together along with other helpful methods.

If you are interested in a fully fledged Mod Manager for TS4, 
you shouold look [@ CursedForge](https://thesims4.curseforge.com)! 
During the time I was creating this script for her, I learned about the newly created mod manager. I was already almost done with this one when I heard of it's upcomming release so I decided to just finished it for the practice and use it as a work-sample my resume ðŸ˜Š.

The original private version (for myself & my sister) supports other script mods but I striped it from this public version since the official mod manager is, well, *official*, is actively supported and has actual ties to the mod makers themselves (and rewards them for doing so!!!). 

Again, if you are looking for a mod manager, **USE [CursedForge for the Sims 4](https://thesims4.curseforge.com)**.

## Original Motivation (pre-CursedForge)

There ~~is~~ was no central hub that TS4 modders used to upload. Mods were often distributed amongst their own personal tumblers, sites, and/or patreon. This script goes out to those individual sites, looks for the **applicable endpoint** that downloads the mod associated with current game version, and then updates the mod.
